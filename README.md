# Panda-3D-Development-History
The development phase of Panda-3D (The game) is a phase that started in 2021 and ended in 2024.
# 2021 (Pre-Testing)
In 2021, the idea of Panda-3D was conceptualized. The game started out as "PANDA 3D TESTING" The build was created during the first month of its creation, meaning screenshots and videos were never released to the public.
This build was originally created in Unity version 2019.4.34
You can see one screenshot of the map at the bottom of this readme
Here is some information about this version of the game:
The build is just the player on a grass floor with stone blocks and a wall (Original version of The wall from Panda-3D) the wall has blue text saying "hi im replay and this is my game"
